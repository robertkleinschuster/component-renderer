## Installation

Install through Composer:

```bash
composer require robertkleinschuster/mosaic
```

## Usage

Here are examples for supported component types:

### Closure Components

Render PHP closures dynamically:

```php
$renderer->render(function ($data) {
    return "Hello, " . $data['name'];
}, ['name' => 'world']);
```

### Fragment Components

Compose UI fragments:

```php
$fragment = $renderer->fragment('<div>Hello, world</div>');
$renderer->render($fragment);
```

### Iterable Components

Loop over iterable data structures:

```php
$items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];
$renderer->render($items);
```

### Renderable Components

Utilize objects implementing the Renderable interface:

```php
class MyComponent implements Renderable {
    public function render(\Mosaic\Renderer $renderer, $data) {
        return $renderer->fragment("<div>Hello, {$data['name']}</div>");
    }
}
$renderer->render(new MyComponent(), ['name' => 'world']);
```

### String Components

Handle simple strings:

```php
$renderer->render("Hello, world");
```
