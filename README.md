# Mosaic

**A Component Renderer for PHP**

Mosaic is a state-of-the-art server-side rendering engine for PHP. It offers an enhanced approach to efficiently and flexibly build and render UI components. Designed specifically for PHP developers, it blends seamlessly with the languageâ€™s native capabilities to deliver a rich, component-oriented development experience.

## Key Advantages

### Designed for PHP Developers
- **PHP-Native Experience**: Tailored for PHP without requiring adherence to an MVC model, Mosaic integrates smoothly into PHP projects, leveraging the language's strengths.

### Flexible Component Types
- **Versatile Component Strategies**: Beyond mere template rendering, Mosaic supports closures, fragments, and renderable objects, promoting modular and reusable design practices.

### Extensible and Customizable
- **Custom Strategies Out-of-the-Box**: The library enables custom rendering strategies for unmatched flexibility, perfect for projects with unique rendering needs.

### Lightweight and Performant
- **Minimal Overhead**: Designed to be lean, Mosaic delivers exceptional performance, suitable for projects ranging from small to large scale.

### Focused on Server-Side Rendering
- **Optimized for Server-Side Efficiency**: Exclusively targeting server-side rendering, it exploits server capabilities for rapid response times and efficient resource use.

## Installation

Install through Composer:

```bash
composer require robertkleinschuster/mosaic
```

## Usage

Here are examples for supported component types:

### String Components

Handle simple strings:

```php
$renderer->render("Hello, world");
```

Strings are escaped by default, to render html use a fragment.

### Fragment Components

Compose UI fragments:

```php
$fragment = $renderer->fragment('<div>Hello, world</div>');
$renderer->render($fragment);
```

### Closure Components

Render PHP closures dynamically:

```php
$renderer->render(function ($data) {
    return "Hello, " . $data['name'];
}, ['name' => 'world']);
```

The return value is evaluated as a component.

### Iterable Components

Loops over iterable of components:

```php
$items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];
$renderer->render($items);
```

This is typically used with the PHP generator syntax:

```php
$items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];
$renderer->render(function() {
    yield "first\n",
    yield "second\n",
    yield "third\n",
});
```

### Renderable Components

Utilize objects implementing the Renderable interface:

```php
class MyComponent implements \Mosaic\Renderable {
    public function render(\Mosaic\Renderer $renderer, $data) {
        yield $renderer->fragment("<div>Hello, {$data['name']}</div>");
    }
}
$renderer->render(new MyComponent(), ['name' => 'world']);
```

In this example the PHP generator syntax is used to yield a child HTML fragment.

### Attribute Components
Wrap a class of closure another component using PHP-8 attributes.

```php
#[Attribute]
class MyWrapper implements \Mosaic\RenderableAttribute {
    public function render(\Mosaic\Renderer $renderer, mixed $children, mixed $data){
        return $renderer->fragment(<<<HTML
<p class="wrapper">
    {$renderer->render($children, $data)}
</p>
HTML
);
    }
}
```

```php
$renderer->render(#[MyWrapper] fn() => 'Hello world!')
```

The string "Hello world!" will now be rendered inside the paragraph defined in the MyWrapper component. 

## Passing parameters to components

```php
$renderer->render(fn(string $name) => "Hello $name!", name: 'world')
```

## Extending Mosaic
